            I started building a personal website today. I chose the Angular framework from Google to do this, primarily because I’ve always wanted to learn it, for such a simple site, most of it’s features are massive overkill. That being said, quite a few of it’s features were useful for this project. I’ll list and explain those here, as well as mention some things I wish I’d known when starting to work with Angular for the first time. If you’re allergic to long walls of text and just want to see some code, you can find the finished project on Github <a href="https://github.com/Turniper/Personal-Site">here</a>. If you’ve already completed a project with Angular, this post probably won’t teach you much, it’s more intended for someone with web development or programming experience who’s using Angular for the first time. Additionally, it’s not intended to be a replacement for a more proper tutorial, but instead to explain some of the more confusing problems and useful tricks I learned over the course of this project. Finally, this post focuses on Angular 2. If you’re working with a different version, be aware that things may work differently then/now. In particular, Angular2 was a pretty large change from Angular 1.X, and several things are done differently.

            Angular is pretty easy to get up and running. Basically all you need is Node, Git, and a suitable development environment. I used Visual Studio Code, and found it excellent for Angular development, but you could use pretty much any text editor out there. If you’ve worked with Ruby on Rails before, npm and nvm will look extremely familiar to you. The syntax and functionality is basically the exact same, just replace rvm with nvm and gem with npm. If you’ve worked with any kind of package manager before, installing Angular and plugins should be pretty easy. Nvm is a version manager for Node.js, and very useful if you plan to be doing substantial amounts of development. If you end up working with multiple projects over long periods of time, you may need multiple versions of Node.js. If you’re new to Angular and haven’t used a version manager before, I recommend skipping this step and just installing Node.js standalone. For new projects, you’ll want to use the most recent versions of the software anyway.

            There are two main ways to start a new Angular Project, command line and pulling from a quickstart repository.  Using the command line, you can create a new project with the following four commands:
            npm-install -g angular-cli (Assuming you haven’t installed the command line interface yet)
            ng new APPNAME (Where APPNAME is the name of your app)
            cd APPNAME
            ng serve
            </p>
            <p>
            You can find more information about the Angular command line interface at https://cli.angular.io/. If you’re using the CLI, be sure to learn about the ng-generate command, for automatically creating skeleton code for several language features.

            <p>
            If you don’t feel like installing the CLI, you can also just pull a quickstart repo. I’m not going to list one here, as there are dozens forked from the official one with various plugins preinstalled. The basic procedure for starting from these repos, assuming you have node and git installed, is to navigate in the command line to the repo directory, then use the npm install and npm start commands in succession.

            Okay, you’ve probably got a site running by now,

            Assuming you don’t have it already, get bootstrap. Angular has a version of bootstrap, ng-bootstrap, which is written in angular directives, making it basically native to the platform. Bootstrap makes

            Components are a special type of angular directive that mimic web components. One of the things they make very convenient, is the ability to create a single component that fully describes an element of your page – content, stylesheets, and dynamic information, all in one place, and then reuse that component with commands like ngFor and ngRepeat wherever you need it. Additionally, using the @input and @output decorator, components can take in or send arguments to/from other components or sources. A simple example of this, would be a blog component, which has a post component that is repeated for each blog post, taking in the content and metadata and handling all of the formatting. Additionally, this post component can have its own hierarchy of child components, such as comments, and use the exact same practice to load and display them. This pattern makes it easy to encapsulate display logic, and allows you to easily reuse the component.

            Angular2 can be used to support both single page applications, like this site, and more traditional multipage applications. While I will explain how to do multi-page apps here, it is important to note, that if you’re using angular for a traditional website, you really should
